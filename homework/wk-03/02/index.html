				<h1>Jenkins on Ice</h1>
				<p class="first">Retired NBA star Dennis Jenkins announced today that he has signed a contract with Long
					Sleep to have
					his body frozen before death, to be revived only when medical science has discovered a cure to the
					aging process.</p>
				<p>'Lots of guys get frozen for cancer and stuff', explains the always-entertaining Jenkins, 'I just
					want to return once they can give me back my eternal youth.' [sic]
					Perhaps Jenkins is also hoping medical science can cure his free-throw shooting - 47% and falling
					during his last year in the league.</p>
				<p>A reader tells us that Jenkins may not be aware that part of the Long Sleep process is to remove the
					head, keeping only the brain to be revived. This would be a problem for Jenkins since he would be
					left without the body he once used to play basketball!</p>
