<h1>Revelation</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
	We make ourselves a place apart
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind light words that tease and flout,
	<br>But oh, the agitated heart
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till someone find us really out.
	<br>
	<br>'Tis pity if the case require'
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Or so we say) that in the end
	<br>We speak the literal to inspire
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The understanding of a friend
	<br>
	<br>But so with all, from babes that play
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At hide-and-seek to God afar,
	<br>So all who hide too well away
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must speak and tell us there they are.
